Utilities for prime calculations in Python using Rust backend.

This project includes a Rust binary backend:

"""
Pseudo-Enum class to define method of prime sieving.

A pseudo-Enum class defined in Rust, this class is NOT an instance of the Python
:class:`enum.Enum` class, even if it behaves mostly in the same way.

There are currently three members available:

- :attr:`SieveMethod.ATKIN`: Modern method, but less well optimised by the compiler;
  not necessarily more performant.
- :attr:`SieveMethod.ERATOSTHENES`: The ancient method. Using the
  :meth:`ndarray.slice_mut().step` method, the compiler can optimise the inner loop
  to a close to ``O(n)`` operation.
- :attr:`SieveMethod.ERATOSTHENES_ATOMIC`: Same method as :attr:`ERATOSTHENES`, but
  conducted on an array of Atomic booleans instead. Allows threading to run without
  much overhead. *This is the default.*
- :attr:`SieveMethod.ERATOSTHENES_THREADED`: *Experimental*. An attempt to introduce
  threading into :attr:``ERATOSTHENES``. It works by using :attr:`ERATOSTHENES` to
  create a base array of primes, upto :func:`Math.sqrt` of the upper bound, then
  split the list of primes into equal size for each worker, then each worker sieve the
  rest of the (larger) numbers.

Check if the given number is prime.

This function checks if a given number is a prime number, and returns a :class:`bool`
indicating the result.

    While this function behaves like a function, it is implemented through
    :class:`~rust_primes.decorators.timed.TimedFunction` and thus contains additional
    functionalities with caching and
    :meth:`~rust_primes.decorators.timed.TimedFunction.timed` executions.

    See :class:`rust_primes.decorators.timed.TimedFunction` for more details.

Parameters
----------
num : int
    The number to be checked.

method : SieveMethod
    The method of sieving to be used for finding the primes.

Returns
-------
bool
    ``True`` if prime, ``False`` otherwise.

List all primes numbers less than or equal to ``num``.

The result is given in a ``List[int]``. Due to the FFI exchange of data between
Rust and Python, this function will be somewhat slower than the
:func:`count_primes` implementation. If you intend to ``len(list_primes(n))``,
use :func:`count_primes` instead.
